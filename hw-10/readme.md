# Assignment 10
For this assignment we had to create objects that collide with one another. I had fun with this and took one of my previous creations and made him move and collide with a red ellipse. I liked the idea to have this cyclops creature move with the mouse and have his arms move back and forth. I also set it so when you move the mouse the creature is repeated over and over again.

## Issues
I had a lot of fun this week in having my creature move. The issue I had was just having the creature move and collide with the red ellipse. I wanted the red ellipse to stay stationary so that I could move the creature to it. Other than that I had a lot of fun with this assignment.
