# Assignment 11
For this assignment we had to create a little game with objects and classes. We had to have objects that were stationary and one that moved around the others and if it were to come in contact the object would loose a life. I set up the canvas with squares that were in a row across the top and side that mirrored each other. While down the middle diagonally there is a line of squares going up in size. If the square that can move touches one of these squares it looses a life.   I added three blue squares as the objects that are suppose to touch and disappear.

## Issues
I did fairly good this week. The only issue I had was trying to get my blue squares to show up when the square would move and collide with them and they would disappear. Other than that I felt comfortable with this weeks assignment.
