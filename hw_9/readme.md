# Assignment 9
For this assignment we had to work with AJAX and jQuery. For my dataset I chose the TV show the Walking Dead. I really like this show that is why I chose to do this assignment on it. I first began by going through all of the tabs on the course website and watching all of the provided videos. I then set up all of my folders in atom and began my assignment.

## Issues
I did run into some issues with this assignment. I am still trying to wrap my head around the concept of AJAX and jQuery and the process of combinding them as we did this week. I had the issue of having my buttons show up but none of my information showed up when I would click the button. When I checked to see if there were any syntax errors there was one with the shows.json I got for my cool data set. When I opened shows.json in atom only some was highlighted showing that it was working and I wasn't sure what was wrong with it I copied it from the site. Besides that I feel confident in the code I just wasn't sure what was going on with the data set not showing up.
