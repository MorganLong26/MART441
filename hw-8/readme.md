# Assignment 8
For this assignment we have to use jquery and continue our use of arrays. I have an image of the Budapest Parliament building fading in when you click the places button. Then the text pops up of the words Budapest Parliament Building. Also, when you click the places button the four squares bordering the outside of the screen move in unison to come together in one spot on the lower left hand side of the screen.

## Issues
I felt much more comfortable this week. I am starting to get the hang of arrays. This was the first time I have used jquery and it took me a little bit to wrap my head around. The example videos were extremely helpful.
