# Assignment 6
This week we had to finish our memory card game. My game is shark themed and it begins with the player typing in their first and last name along with their age. They hit submit below the name and age boxes and it takes the player to the next page. The next page is two rows of five cards, ten cards total. The player then chooses one card at a time in hopes of getting the matching shark photo. Once they have found all of the matches the page will automatically go to the third and final page. This page says final score at the top with the players name and score.

## Issues
I did struggle with this assignment. Specifically JSON and local storages they really gave me issues. For some reason my page one and three only pop up if you open it in atom and open in browser. I apologize for this I'm not quite sure why it is doing that. Other than that it went fairly smooth. I watched all the course videos and went through the examples. I did email my professor for help during part 1 and part 2 of this assignment. My questions were answered right away. After this assignment I do feel like I have a much better understanding of JSON, arrays, and strings.
