# Homework 2
For this assignment we are working with JavaScript. I have had experience working with JavaScript before in my Creative Coding 1 class. However it is my first time combining JavaScript and html. After watching the video lecture and going through all of the sections on the course website I feel pretty comfortable with the combination of JavaScript and html. I didn't know until now what the main purpose of html, css, and JavaScript were.

## Work Progress
- I first began by watching the video lectures to understand the new material and homework.
- Then I set up my homework with the correct file arrangement.
- I set up the html and header up as normal and added a pink background.
- Next, I set up the script link so I could have the console.log in a separate JavaScript tag.
- After I made sure the link was working I answered all of the questions in console.log.
- Once completed I pushed my links to GitHub and submitted my links to Moodle.

### Issues
I didn't have any issues this week. I just referenced back to the course website and the lecture videos.
