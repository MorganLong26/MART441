# Assignment 3
For this assignment we have to make a choose your own adventure. My project is three doors and you'll have to choose one of the three. There will be something different behind each one. I'm not quite sure what will be behind the doors just yet. The set up of my page is a blue background with the text in the center explaining what you have to do. Then under the text are three different looking doors. The variables I defined were the doors. Then I have the text being printed write to the document.

## Successes and Challenges
I was successful at declaring the variables and having the my words print on to the document. I am happy with the set up right now. I feel like it is a good start for this project. I didn't struggle with much because I used the videos and examples from the course web site when I had questions. The only thing I'm trying to figure out is how I should approach adding the areas that are behind the door when you click on the door.
