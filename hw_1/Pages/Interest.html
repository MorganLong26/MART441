    <h1>My Interests</h1>
    <p>In the future I hope to have acheived my BFA degree. I'm currently
    looking jobs in Seattle. Such as, Microsoft Seattle. My cousins husband
  works there as a programer. He has told me about all of Microsofts interships
and positions. Some of my hobbies include photography, film editing, reading,
knitting, shopping, etc. When I was a child I never really thought about what I wanted to be when
I grew up. I did like history so for a while I thought I might do something
related to history. </p>
