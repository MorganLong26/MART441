# Assignment 7
For this assignment we had to make a viewfinder. I chose to make my viewfinder about famous paintings. I learned about objects, arrays, and methods. I feel more comfortable with the subject of objects. I did deal with objects and arrays in creative coding and I struggled with them then. It took me a while for me to wrap my head around, but I do feel as though I understand them more. My button is on the side of the Starry Night image (its a little weird to find).

## Issues
I did struggle with this assignment. I do feel at the end more comfortable with the new material learned. The only thing I was unsuccessful at was the changing of the information once the button was clicked.I got my pictures to pop up and I have the title, author, etc, but I couldn't get the information to change when I clicked advance button. I'm not sure why it wouldn't change.
